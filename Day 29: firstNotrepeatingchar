Problem Desription:
Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

Example

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
solution(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

Code:
from collections import Counter

def solution(s):
    char_counts = Counter(s)
    for char in s:
        if char_counts[char] == 1:
            return char
    return '_'
