Problem Description:
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
solution(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
solution(sequence) = true.


Code:
def solution(arr):
    n=len(arr)
    count = 0

    index = -1

    for i in range(1, n):
 
        if (arr[i - 1] >= arr[i]):
            count += 1

            index = i

    if (count > 1):
        return False

    if (count == 0):
        return True
 

    if (index == n - 1 or index == 1):
        return True
 
    if (arr[index - 1] < arr[index + 1]):
        return True
 
    if (arr[index - 2] < arr[index]):
        return True
 
    return False
