#Problem Description:
Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

Example

For s1 = "aabcc" and s2 = "adcaa", the output should be
solution(s1, s2) = 3.

Strings have 3 common characters - 2 "a"s and 1 "c".


#Code:
def solution(s1, s2):
    count=0
    temp=s2
    l=list(s2)
    for i in s1:
        for j in range(len(l)):
            if i==l[j]:
                count+=1
                del(l[j])
                break
    return count
