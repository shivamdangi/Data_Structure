Container with Most Water

Problem Description:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.


Code:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n=height.size();
        int left=0;
        int right=n-1;
        int maxarea=0;

        while(left<right){
            int area=(right-left)* min(height[left],height[right]);
            maxarea=max(maxarea,area);

            if(height[left]<height[right]){
                left++;
            }
            else{
                right--;
            }

        }
        return maxarea;
    }
};
```
