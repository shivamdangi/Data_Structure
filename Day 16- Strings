Problem Description:
Given a string, your task is to replace each of its characters by the next one in the English alphabet; i.e. replace a with b, replace b with c, etc (z would be replaced by a).

Example

For inputString = "crazy", the output should be solution(inputString) = "dsbaz".


Code:
def solution(string):
    char_list = list(string)
    for i in range(len(char_list)):
        char = char_list[i]
        if char.isalpha():
            
            char_list[i] = chr(ord(char) + 1)
            if char=='z':
                char_list[i]='a'
    return ''.join(char_list)
